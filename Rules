Generate Documentation and Comments:

We'll use Rust's built-in documentation system ( for public items and  for module-level documentation).
Inline comments () will be added to explain non-obvious parts of the code.
Split the Project into Multiple Files and Directories:

We'll organize the project into modules and submodules for better readability and maintainability.
For example, packet-related logic, threading, and configuration will be separated into their own files.
Target Unix Systems (Ubuntu) but Ensure Cross-Platform Compatibility:

We'll use conditional compilation (#[cfg(target_os = "windows")] and #[cfg(target_family = "unix")]) to handle OS-specific differences.
For example, raw socket handling may differ between Unix and Windows.
Follow Rust Coding Standards:

We'll adhere to Rust's idiomatic coding practices, such as using clippy for linting and rustfmt for formatting.
We'll use Result and Option for error handling and avoid unwrap unless absolutely necessary.
